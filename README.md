# 🗂️ Auto-Cleaner (Python CLI)

A simple and efficient **Python command-line tool** that automatically organizes your messy folders into neatly categorized directories.  
This project is built using only Python’s standard libraries — no external dependencies required.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Automatically sorts files by type (Images, Videos, Documents, Music, Code, etc.)
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight — runs directly from the terminal

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Set your **source folder path** (the messy folder).
2. Set your **destination folder path** (where organized files will be moved).
3. Run the script — all files will be sorted into folders like:
   - Images
   - Videos
   - Documents
   - Music
   - Archives
   - Code
   - Others
